DESCRIPTION

Home page: http://sourceforge.net/projects/zimbrafunambol

Synchronize funambol with zimbra. Connector can synchronize the follow items:
- Contacts  (text/x-s4j-sifc and text/x-vcard)
- Calendars (text/x-s4j-sife and text/x-vcalendar)
- Tasks     (text/x-s4j-sift and text/calendar)
Connector can't synchronize Notes (But Zimbra 7 also has none anymore)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIREMENTS

Funambol v8.0.1 -  think it will be work on all v8.0.1 ds-servers and higher
Zimbra v5.0.x, v6.x, v7.x
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUILD

Requirements to build:
  - JDK
  - Apache ANT
  - Funambol library (which is delivered with the source in the dslib folder)

Unzip the ZimbraConnector.zip in a folder, for example ZimbraConnector.
Or get the code from svn, via: svn checkout https://zimbrafunambol.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/zimbrafunambol/trunk ZimbraConnector

Connector distribution include builded connector ZimbraConnector/output/ZimbraConnector.s4j

If you want to build this connector for an alternative version of Funambol, than it's originally build from,
replace the funambol libs in the dslibs folder with the funambol libs from your version (see your Funambol installation for those jars).
Be sure to remove the old version.

If you want build connector from source then you should move to ZimbraConnector and exec the following commands:
  cd ZimbraConnector
  ant clean
  ant source

Afte this you could check the INSTALLATION part in this README for the rest of the installation process.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST

If you want run tests then you must use user.properties file and settings.properties in the test folder of project.

user.properties have to contain username and password properties, example:
username= MyName
password= MyName

settings.properties have to contain zimbra-server and may contain keystoke properties;
zimbra-server - point to zimbra soap service URL
keystoke - point to CA certs for zimbra server (required if you use SSL)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION:
No any special action required - Use funambol manual for install connector

If you use ssl, then make sure that you set keystoke path:
set JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore="%~dp0..\lib\security\cacerts"

By installing you should put ZimbraConnector.xml in /opt/Funambol/config/connector with the correct configuration. With the following content (a reference to the database connection this module uses):
-------------------------------
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<java version="1.5.0" class="java.beans.XMLDecoder">
		<object class="ru.korusconsulting.connector.config.ConnectorConfig">
			<void property="dataSource">
				<string>jdbc/fnblds</string>
			</void>
		</object>
	</java>
-------------------------------
